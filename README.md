## Greetings observer!

My name is Pieng, currently a software engineer based in Japan.

I am fairly new as a software engineer, although I did have an experience as a product owner before.

My main stack currently is: Python (Django), Vue.js, and PostgreSQL. I am learning these through doing the projects I have pinned down if you want to see!

I am also very passionate about video games and hope to be able to publish a meaningful one one day! If anyone want to talk about this, please reach out!

About me:
* I love many genres of music, mainly JPOP, KPOP, Western, Thai
* I play and know LOTS of video games
* I used to play volleyball but not at all since coming to Japan
